# Autonomous Gunslinger resume handoff

## Durable objective

Execute `AUTONOMOUS-GUNSLINGER-MISSION.md` continuously until its complete
definition of done or a listed genuine human-input hard stop.

## Repository state

- Branch: `codex/complete-gunslinger`
- Audited HEAD: `0f49720` (Sprint 34 repaired exact class-contract observer).
- Qualified baseline contained: `4f28dcf` runtime implementation and `5c92012`
  documentation.
- Current checkpoint: Sprint 34 Gunslinger class chassis.
- Version: `0.0.34` (Sprint 34 source work active).
- User-supplied worktree inputs `AGENTS.md` and
  `AUTONOMOUS-GUNSLINGER-MISSION.md` must be preserved.

## Last runtime evidence

- Exact Sprint 31 catalog commit `1539ae9` passed `mod-load-smoke`, run ID
  `20260801T1334059331758Z-9736bc0a7d7844bd83bc9d26b5a30676`.
- Two fresh-process `production-firearm-catalog` PASS runs:
  `20260801T1335276981327Z-5145ec8fbc864500889d489fb4c23fad` and
  `20260801T1336546357107Z-1986affde5794aad8eb0710a31932eb0`.
- Exact deployed package SHA-256:
  `0ca093bd05eaa19a6dc3e3577b618fea2b3db018b29e61965fc0742815e2c342`;

  `c0e59abe94e89ec478a55c43327c8ce7763851dc1d50f4a141c39e7ad0767473`.
  Both feature runs proved the three concrete catalog entries, marker/native
  isolation, special-range fail-closed behavior, stable working-save identity,
  and no save write.

- Exact Sprint 31 entry commit `67d7779` passed `mod-load-smoke`, run ID
  `20260801T1309524765214Z-f92ce74df2bc4c6695e6cdd3a6bbeeed`, and canonical

  The working save was uniquely correlated, the baseline was distinct and not
  loaded, the fingerprint was stable, and no save-writing API was observed.
- Exact commit `47fb861` passed `mod-load-smoke`, run ID
  `20260801T0435526657821Z-4ba4ea84718947f1a8cfc3de1d6ad76a`.

  `b1422ae9a2aed50a0ae8a8d2d3f4ff0defc5d03d31f142d7a19c57f5eb973d7b`.
- First active Sprint 33 invariant: exact multi-round state and inventory
  deltas remain atomic across partial top-up, persistence, repeated discharge,
  misfire, and two otherwise identical firearms.

## Current source evidence

- Sprint 32 exact-reference target planning is implemented with 10 focused
  cases. Native cone/volley aggregation adds 10, one-discharge transactions add
  seven, triple-explosion policy adds six, and the fail-closed cone-distance
  boundary adds five; the complete domain suite is 662/662 PASS.
- Package candidate SHA-256:
  `e45b9e2253435a1e5926dccc6c9e00a9cadc96ae25af404a2749e0cc6249a639`;

  `33b9cddac997428d945c35e156f04ee004e7109d1a10bb08ed5fa409886c67f7`.
- This slice is source-qualified only. It does not establish cone length,
  native attack delivery or feature runtime acceptance. Native 90-degree
  directional geometry is contract-proven; numeric cone distance is not.
- Sprint 33 exact batch reload and partial top-up transactions add eight
  focused cases. Complete suite is 670/670 PASS. Package candidate SHA-256 is
  `f04448c1cc8de40b9eae5ad781730a4c911a10cd3d9aec83ce6f560d2710dd55`;

  `75788f9ff56f76a3012754802e0c78d847da11c6c1ecd806abada23e065e2b51`.
- Advanced Rifle/Revolver definitions, six-round finite token semantics, and
  capacity-aware early/advanced misfire handling add twelve more focused cases;
  complete suite is 682/682 PASS. Latest package SHA-256 is
  `35527b3cba8d7764b3882e8910c58d43bc600741c1e13bc33ba6ff679afde94a`;

- Save-owned-vault reconstruction, two-item count isolation, and repeated
  canonical discharge add three cases; complete suite is 685/685 PASS. Latest
  package SHA-256 is
  `ea88730ad1a2aa208de081fb4e8e68000dc53e26be17b24403eeda1cd3d4d26e`;

- Four stable advanced blueprint IDs now produce exact Rifle/Revolver item/type
  pairs and extend guarded catalog acceptance. Complete suite remains 685/685
  PASS. Latest package SHA-256 is
  `30e5f6b53efcdef9068e2524945bad49b06a78e77ce745c9c29afc79bf0ad957`;

  `20260801T1433034839705Z-56c2363396894593961542057943f189` and two expanded
  catalog runs `20260801T1434411929092Z-b69f2b13cc1f4a03945624f83ff3c5b9`
  and `20260801T1436113008241Z-3c3f36a8807e4ed3869826afd13a5543`.
  Both feature runs observed no save-writing API. Exact deployed package/DLL
  SHA-256 are `6a8386e782f47726c38be60cda52e5e9b335d943a3650426cf6263c5deb51cf2`

  Exact private-reference Release build and strict package validation passed.
  Runtime package SHA-256 is

## Sprint 30 closure

Commit `0052dad` passed exact mod load and two fresh-process feature runs. Latest
run ID is `20260801T0448285054152Z-4e5925080ce1422fbcb44c2ee07adcac`;
deployed DLL SHA-256 is
`de9f8507e5180adeb5df8dab4559e901da68022be556ef4fe1ffb874034e3d3f`.
Both feature runs reached `MaintenanceLoopPassed`, proved native Heavy Crossbow
isolation, and observed no save write.

## Next action

Do not use `UnitDescriptor.AddStartingInventory` for class items: guarded run
`20260801T1653067738684Z-31c75c40cc2642038ec2771b3c2325fd` proved it grants
the default `BlueprintUnit` inventory instead. Inspect the exact native
`LevelUpController.Commit`/`SetupNewCharacher` call contract read-only, then
build a separately guarded disposable creation-commit scenario that requires
the three class item identities and unchanged player/global-unit snapshots.

## Safety boundaries

Launch only through Steam App ID 640820 and the guarded request mechanism. Use
only `KMG_AUTOMATION_WORKING`; never load or mutate
`KMG_AUTOMATION_BASELINE`. Never save, quicksave, send UI input, or infer a save
from Continue/newest ordering. Stop on ambiguous identity, entitlement, UI,
prerequisite, save-write, or result evidence.
