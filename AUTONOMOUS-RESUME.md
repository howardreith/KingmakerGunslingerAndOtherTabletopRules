# Autonomous Gunslinger resume handoff

## Durable objective

Execute `AUTONOMOUS-GUNSLINGER-MISSION.md` continuously until its complete
definition of done or a listed genuine human-input hard stop.

## Repository state

- Branch: `codex/complete-gunslinger`
- Audited HEAD: `5c92012701873421adff1fc0e127b0b3597c352c`
- Qualified baseline contained: `4f28dcf` runtime implementation and `5c92012`
  documentation.
- Current checkpoint: early production firearm catalog.
- Version: `0.0.31` (Sprint 31 in progress).
- User-supplied worktree inputs `AGENTS.md` and
  `AUTONOMOUS-GUNSLINGER-MISSION.md` must be preserved.

## Last runtime evidence

- Exact commit `47fb861` passed `mod-load-smoke`, run ID
  `20260801T0435526657821Z-4ba4ea84718947f1a8cfc3de1d6ad76a`.
- Exact commit `47fb861` passed canonical `working-save-smoke`, run ID
  `20260801T0437220565711Z-d8664d7f634542f58d8d95126e90fe51`.
- Working-save evidence directory:
  `C:\Dev\KingmakerGunslingerLab\runtime-evidence\20260801T0437220409268Z-working-save-smoke`.
- Deployed DLL SHA-256:
  `b1422ae9a2aed50a0ae8a8d2d3f4ff0defc5d03d31f142d7a19c57f5eb973d7b`.
- First unproved invariant: generic marker-first Reload/Repair/Overhaul retains
  production pistol, musket, and blunderbuss definition-specific behavior and
  identity without native Heavy Crossbow leakage.

## Commands already run

- Read mission, roadmap, Sprint 30 report/entry criteria, architecture, source
  and test inventories, version files, and local class/firearm rule headings.
- Verified `codex/complete-gunslinger` descends from the qualified baseline.
- Repository validation passed. Exact Release domain suite passed 611/611.
  Exact private-reference Release build and strict package validation passed.
  Runtime package SHA-256 is
  `b253eaed27bccfd7841ca938032373bb13146984e94c021b1994cbd901397dfd`;

## Sprint 30 closure

Commit `0052dad` passed exact mod load and two fresh-process feature runs. Latest
run ID is `20260801T0448285054152Z-4e5925080ce1422fbcb44c2ee07adcac`;
deployed DLL SHA-256 is
`de9f8507e5180adeb5df8dab4559e901da68022be556ef4fe1ffb874034e3d3f`.
Both feature runs reached `MaintenanceLoopPassed`, proved native Heavy Crossbow
isolation, and observed no save write.

## Next action

Commit the source-qualified Sprint 31 entry/pistol-definition checkpoint, then
run guarded exact-version `0.0.31` mod-load and canonical working-save smoke.
After that, implement stable production pistol/musket/blunderbuss blueprint
contracts and registrations with focused definition, marker, stable-ID,
presentation, and generic-action tests. Do not invent a numeric blunderbuss
range: the authoritative table says `special`, and scatter remains Sprint 32.

## Safety boundaries

Launch only through Steam App ID 640820 and the guarded request mechanism. Use
only `KMG_AUTOMATION_WORKING`; never load or mutate
`KMG_AUTOMATION_BASELINE`. Never save, quicksave, send UI input, or infer a save
from Continue/newest ordering. Stop on ambiguous identity, entitlement, UI,
prerequisite, save-write, or result evidence.
