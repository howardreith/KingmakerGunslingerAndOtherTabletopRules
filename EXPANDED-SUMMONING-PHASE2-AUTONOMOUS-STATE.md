# Expanded Summoning Phase 2 autonomous state

This is the live resume record for the owner's Phase 2 Sprints 9-21 mission in
`Kingmaker_Expanded_Summoning_Phase2_Codex_Starter_Packet.zip`. That order
supersedes the Phase 1 handoff's historical prohibition on starting Sprint 9.

## Current position

- Tranche: 2A, Sprints 9-13. Current sprint: 9, Eagle and Dire Bat.
- Branch: `codex/expanded-summoning-phase2a-sprints9-13` in
  `.worktrees/expanded-summoning-phase2a`.
- Accepted dependency: `master` / `origin/master` at
  `2ce70e4e7e9d3c97ca1008ab05a341e758f5cf5a`, the merged PR #24 Favored
  Class integration. The owner packet's expected `2943a02d` is its ancestor.
- Branch head at intake: `2ce70e4e7e9d3c97ca1008ab05a341e758f5cf5a`.
- Exact Phase 2 tested candidate: none yet. Implementation status: planned;
  publication status: unchanged from accepted master. No Phase 2 creature has
  been claimed complete.
- HumanReview: NOT_PERFORMED_NONBLOCKING. Internal Phase 2 reviews: pending.
- Blockers: none established. A difficult rig is not by itself a blocker.

## Verified intake and baseline

- The owner packet's mission, charter sections 1-5, Sprint 9-21 sections,
  Appendix A rows, roster workbook sheets, and summoning guide were read.
  Repository Phase 1 handoff, state, report, journal, program state, generated
  roster and fidelity/traceability records, icon guide/index/catalog, Pteranodon
  source/runtime pipeline, and guarded runtime instructions were inspected.
- Accepted master has 81 unique creatures, SM 74 base entries / 414 logical
  placements, SNA 71 / 399, total 813. Dire Bat's 14 placements remain
  registered and hidden; Eagle and Dire Bat share the native Giant Eagle donor.
- The accepted master uses local-development version `0.0.140`. No public Phase
  2 version or release has been chosen.
- Clean `scripts/Build-Local.ps1` on accepted `2ce70e4`: repository wrapper
  PASS; all 1,918 domain cases PASS; exact-reference Release build PASS; strict
  standalone UMM package PASS. Local package SHA-256
  `28691a8db147312409b87d4e044664355721a3f8b0437a318d10947a6707b836`;
  DLL SHA-256
  `08ddda2c7fff06e7124b45596194dd0371f06ab7e1c38d12595f416bab1e25f0`.
  These are baseline hashes, not Phase 2 candidate hashes.
- Guarded `observe-expanded-summoning-native-donors` on `2ce70e4` / version
  `0.0.140`: PASS, evidence
  `20260927T0251122942654Z-observe-expanded-summoning-native-donors`.
  Restoration record
  `20260927T0253210207995Z-observe-expanded-summoning-native-donors.json`:
  live tree 136 files and SHA-256
  `216A9DC2B8E95CD644BA3CADC69A638463C25E60F40A11F8D4B2065C69D5AAF3`
  both before and after. The guard launched through Steam App ID 640820.
- The audit found native `Blindsight` GUID
  `236ec7f226d3d784884f066aa4be1570`, but its 60-foot **blindsight** and
  blindness immunity are too strong for Dire Bat blindsense. Native
  `Blindsense` component behavior is proven by the existing Nereid scenario;
  Sprint 9 requires a bounded, creature-owned sense fact and live verification.
- Source discrepancy: Appendix A's generated row labels Dire Bat `S10`, while
  the detailed charter, generated traceability ledger, and controlling Phase 2
  mission all place it in Sprint 9. Follow Sprint 9.

## Standing boundaries and next action

`OwnerAcceptedEngineLimitation: ACTIVE_SUMMON_GRAPPLES_RESET_SAFELY_ON_RELOAD`.
Active holds and mouth occupancy return cleanly released on reload. Do not
implement hold re-establishment or call this grapple persistence.

Next: inspect the local approved Pteranodon rig capture and source generator;
design an instance-local Eagle/Bat visual extension with native fallback;
write focused failing Sprint 9 tests; implement and validate each narrow change.
Do not unhide Dire Bat until its model, blindsense, icon, mechanics, and live
qualification pass. Continue through A, B and C without an intermediate owner
decision. Open three stacked PRs as the tranche gates pass. No merge, release,
permanent deployment, or Sprint 22.
